.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a music player.
It manages a playing queue of music files.
When it finishes to play a track,
.Nm
proceeds to the next file in the queue, or with the first one if
the currently playing track is not in the playing queue.
When it reaces the end, by default, it wraps back to the first track.
.Pp
.Nm
automatically skips and removes from the playing queue non-regular files,
or ones with a non-recognized audio format.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

Do not daemonize:
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to standard error.
It's ignored if any commands are given on the command line, or if the
server is already running.

the
.Ar time
is interpreted as a percentage of the length of the track.
